# .files
My dot files

`configure.sh` yum installs git, then customizes to my liking

[`configure_general.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeyism/.files/master/configure_general.sh) yum installs tmux and git, then customizes to my liking

[`run.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeyism/.files/master/run.sh) adds the dot-files and configures vim, but doesn't install anything via yum nor apt

[`run_apt.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeyism/.files/master/run_apt.sh) like `run.sh` above, but apt installs some stuff
